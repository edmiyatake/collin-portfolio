# 🎬 Secret Portfolio Project for a Friend

This is a surprise project I built for a close friend to showcase their passion and talent as a filmmaker.

## 🎁 About This Project

I wanted to create something special that reflects his work in both live events and videography. Without his knowledge, I designed and developed a **fully responsive portfolio website** to highlight:

- His past projects and experience
- Aesthetic that reflects his creative style
- A simple, elegant layout with smooth visuals and media support

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **React** + **Vite** for fast development and easy deployment
- **CSS Modules** and custom design for a unique look
- **YouTube API** for embedding video content
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

## 🔍 Features

- Scroll-based photo and video reel
- Dynamic layout with custom gradients and imagery
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- Fully muted and autoplaying embedded video (with visibility control)

## 💡 Why I Made It

This project was created secretly as a **gift** to celebrate my friend's creative journey. My goal was to give him a platform he could easily update and share — something professional, personal, and made just for him.
